\section{Purpose}
This document is the R.A.S.D. (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document).
This document is intended to the description of the "myTaxiService" system. 
At first, it will provide functional and non-functional requirements, a complete overview of the system's constraints and its limits. Then it will explain in detail the dynamics of the system using real-life use cases.
Finally this document will provide a base for the developers that have to concretely implement the system.
