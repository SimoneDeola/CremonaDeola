	\subsection{Taxi Driver Registration}
		Runtime View relative to the Scenario S.3 of the RASD.\\
		The registration of a Taxi Driver is quite similar to the registration of a Customer.
		For the sake of brevity, this kind of registration is not modeled with a Sequence Diagram because it's sufficient to take the \hyperref[subsec:RegistrationNewAccount]{"Registration Through The Creation Of A New myTaxiService Account"} and substitute the "registerUser(username, password, email)" call with a "taxiDriverRegistration(username, password, email, license, taxiNumber)" call.
