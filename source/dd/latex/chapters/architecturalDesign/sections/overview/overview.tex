	\section{Overview}
		MyTaxiService system architecture has been designed as a 3-tier architecture (Data Tier, Logic Tier and Presentation Tier) to facilitate the development of the system using the MVC software design pattern. In fact the three tier represents in some way the Model (Data Tier), the Controller (Logic Tier) and the View (Presentation Tier) of the software.
		\\
		The architecture of the system is described by the following figure:

		\end{figure}
		The components of the system are divided in the three tiers:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In the Presentation Tier there are imoplemented classes and the objects that compose the view part (what the user see). From this tier users can perform actions to query the system and use the web and mobile applications.
			\item The Logic Tier is the place where are implemented classes and objects that compose the controller (actual logic of the system). This part is in charge of taking requests by the users applciations and perform changes on the data. This part is also in charge to notify the applications (presentation tier) of the data changes.
			\item The Data Tier is the place where are implemented the classes and the object that interacts directly with the database. These objects represents the entities of the database and are able to perform creation, modification and deletion of database records.
		\end{itemize}
