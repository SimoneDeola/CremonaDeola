	\chapter{Architectural Design}
		In this chapter there will be described the architecture of the system and the various components that will compose the system.
		Here it's also described how these components will interact to each other to perform the various tasks that the system have to do to provide to the users the functions described in the RASD document.
		Finally, there will be described what architectural styles and patterns have been used to design the entire system.
