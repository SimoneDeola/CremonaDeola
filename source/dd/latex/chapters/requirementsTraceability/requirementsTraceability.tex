	\chapter{Requirements Traceability}
		In this section, we analyse every single Functional Requirement (ordered by Goals described in the RASD) and it's indicated in which components these requirements are implemented.

		All the Goals (G.x) are well described in the RASD at section 3.2

		\section{G.1}
			With the Goal G.1, we want to allow Guest Users to become Customers by creating a new myTaxiService account.
			Here are the requirements for this goal:
