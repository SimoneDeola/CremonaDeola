	This method does nothing, it returns only an empty array.
	
	\item The two methods "init()" and "initialize()" perform the same functionality and are public. This means that if i want to call the initialization process i don't know what is the right method. Make the initialization univocal, to do that eliminate one method or make one of it private.
	
\item 
 \lstinputlisting[language=Java, firstline=496, lastline=496, firstnumber=496]{../src/StandardService.java}
	
	Can't find this function ( log.error(*)) in the documentation.
	
\item	The two function addConnector() and removeConnection() are not fully commented, the first part of each class is not so explanatory and need some comment for the steps of the algorithms.
