		For the integration testing, we have to populate the Database with some demo users. It will be required to check credentials, update positions etc...
		To emulate the GPS (that is external to the system) the integration testing needs some classes that simulate a real GPS.
		To perform integration testing on the login and registration with Facebook it will be required to emulate the responses from the Facebook Login API.
		In general, if the components of the system are integrated during the development of the system itself it will be required to create some drivers that emulate the desired behavior.
