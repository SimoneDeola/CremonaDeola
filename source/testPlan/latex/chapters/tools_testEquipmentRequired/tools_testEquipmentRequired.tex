	\chapter{Tools and Test Equipment Required}

			In general, the tools used for integration testing depend on the programming language used for the development of the system.
			We assume that the system is currently developed in Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition).
			With respect to this assumption, required tools for the integration test are:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item JUnit: to make unit testing. (reference: \url{http://junit.org})
				\item Arquillian: to make drivers for the bottom-up testing strategy (reference: \url{http://arquillian.org})
				\item Manual testing can be considered a testing tool and can be used if necessary.
			\end{itemize}
