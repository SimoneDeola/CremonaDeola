\section{Scenarios}
	Here are described in natural language some useful scenarios that shows how the system should work in different cases:

		\subsection{S.1 Registration as a Customer creating a myTaxiService account}\label{sec:NormalCustomerRegistrationScenario}
		To read the Functional Requirements for this scenario, refer to \hyperref[sec:frs1]{G.1 Functional Requirements Specification}\\

		Aristotle is new in the system and he wants to simplify the way he calls for a taxi. So he download the "myTaxiService" application from the Play Store (since he has a smartphone with the fancy Android 5.0 Lollipop Operative System) and he open it.
		The application shows to Aristotle the login screen and he taps on the "Sign Up as a Customer" button (see \hyperref[login_m]{Login Screen}) going to the registration page. In that page, he has to fill the form (see \hyperref[cregistration_m]{Customer Registration Screen (Mobile)}) and after that he clicks on the "Accept" button. If the data entered by Aristotle is ok, he is automatically logged in and he can start using myTaxiService. Otherwise, he is redirected to an error page, that describes what is the problem. 

		\subsection{S.2 Registration as a Customer using a Facebook Account}\label{sec:FacebookCustomerRegistrationScenario}
		To read the Functional Requirements for this scenario, refer to \hyperref[sec:frs2]{G.2 Functional Requirements Specifications}\\

		Pythagoras is new in the system and he wants to simplify the way he calls for a taxi, but he doesn't want to loose time inserting his credential into a boring registration form, so he decide to register with his Facebook Account.
		He download the application from the Apple App Store (since he has a glorious iPhone 6 Plus) and he open it.
		The application shows to Pythagoras the login screen and he taps on the "Log in With Facebook" button calling the Facebook Login API.
		If the registration is successful, the Facebook System will reply with the informations about the user and the myTaxiService system can create a record in the database with Pythagoras informations. Otherwise, he is redirected to an error page, that describes what is the problem.

		\subsection{S.3 Registration as a Taxi Driver creating a new Taxi Driver myTaxiService account.}\label{sec:TaxiDriverRegistrationScenario}
		To read the Functional Requirements for this scenario, refer to \hyperref[sec:frs3]{G.3 Functional Requirements Specifications}\\

		Thales is a great taxi worker
